# Description:
# Uses Traceroute on target IP,
# Attempts to ping target IP 5 times
# Checks to see if ports 22, 80, and
# 443 are open or closed

# Usage:
# Run script with target IP or web address
# potentially scanme.nmap.org


# Check if a target was provided as an argument
if [ "$#" -ne 1 ]; then
